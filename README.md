## Project Description

+ Project title: Data Cleaning, Predictive Analytics, Model Evaluation and Selection
+ This project is conducted by Jongyoon Sohn


This project involves building a function or API that will read the news across many sites and database to analyze it. Using the preprocessed database, 29 stocks from NASDAQ were quoted to predict their returns using AI capabilities(**Deep Neural Network**, **Random Forest**, **Support Vector Machine**) based on the news and historical prices with the probability associated to the up and down.

In this project, I carried out **model evaluation and selection** for predictive analytics on text data. As data scientists, we often need to **evaluate** different modeling/analysis strategies and decide what is the best. Such decisions need to be supported by sound evidence in the form of *model assessment, validation and comparison*. In addition, we also need to **communicate our decision and supporting evidence** clearly and convincingly in an accessible fashion.
